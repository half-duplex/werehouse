<ul>
    <li>Search has not been implemented yet. Iâ€™m figuring out how it should work.</li>
    <li>Deleting your account does not work yet.</li>
    <li>Downloading your data does not work yet.</li>
    <li>There is no way to filter your archive to show only records with a specific category.</li>
    <li>The two pages which allow file uploads do not yet support drag-and-drop.</li>
    <li>There is no way to merge tags/groups/artists/etc. that are on different pages.</li>
    <li>It is not possible to undo a mistaken operation.</li>
    <li>When resuming from inactivity, Werehouse does not check whether you've
        entered text on a page, and will reload the page, wiping away the text
        you entered.</li>
    <li>The text in the interface is not aligned to a baseline grid.</li>
    <li>The help/documentation is insufficient.</li>
    <li>Clicking <q>Cancel</q> in the dialog that opens after making a new
        record group with <q>New Group with Selection</q> leaves the group
        there.  This is because it just displays the same dialog as when you
        click <q>Edit</q> on a record group, but it doesn't exactly make
        sense.</li>
</ul>
