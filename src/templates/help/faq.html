  <summary><h2>How do I invite someone?</h2></summary>
  <p>
    To invite someone to use this instance of Werehouse, follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Send a message to whoever runs this instance and ask them to “add an
      invite link to your account.”
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to your
      <a href="/account#invite-links"
        >account page and scroll down to the Invite Links section</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should see that you have 1 invite link that doesn’t say “Used.” Copy
      that link and send it to the person you’d like to invite.
    </li>
  </ol>

      Why does Werehouse only support Mastodon servers, not other Fediverse
      server software?
    </h2>
  </summary>
  <p>
    Mastodon offers a client API that is easy to integrate into Werehouse and
    requires no authorization. However, if Werehouse wants to directly speak
    ActivityPub, it basically needs to become an ActivityPub server! This is
    because of features like
    <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/security/"
      >Secure Mode in Mastodon</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/federation/http_signatures/"
      >the default configuration for GoToSocial</a
    >. These features require that Werehouse provide a valid ActivityPub server
    signature on its requests, which in turn requires creating an “instance
    actor” to allow other ActivityPub servers to find its public key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Werehouse will eventually support ActivityPub properly, after I’ve had
    sufficient time to develop, test, and try out the ActivityPub code.
