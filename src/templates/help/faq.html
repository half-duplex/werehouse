  <summary><strong>How do I add something to Werehouse?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    There are three ways to add something to your archive in Werehouse
    currently:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Web Form</strong><br />Go to the
      <a href="/enqueue">Add to Queue</a> page and submit a link or a file.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Telegram Bot</strong><br />If you haven’t already, send
      <code>/start</code> to
      <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/werehouse_archive_bot"
        >@werehouse_archive_bot on Telegram</a
      >
      and click the link it sends you. This will link your Telegram account with
      Werehouse. Then, you can forward messages to that bot to add links and
      images to your queue.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Manual Upload</strong><br />Go to the
      <a href="/archive">Archive</a> page and submit an image file.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Soon, Werehouse will support manually archiving videos too. I have yet to
    figure out how I want to create thumbnails from videos, which is why it
    isn’t supported already.

  <summary><strong>How do I invite someone?</strong></summary>
  <p>
    To invite someone to use this instance of Werehouse, follow these steps:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Send a message to whoever runs this instance and ask them to “add an
      invite link to your account.”
    </li>
    <li>
      Go to your
      <a href="/account#invite-links"
        >account page and scroll down to the Invite Links section</a
      >.
    </li>
    <li>
      You should see that you have 1 invite link that doesn’t say “Used.” Copy
      that link and send it to the person you’d like to invite.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <summary>
    <strong
      >Why does Werehouse only support Mastodon servers, not other Fediverse
      server software?</strong
    >
  </summary>
  <p>
    Mastodon offers a client API that is easy to integrate into Werehouse and
    requires no authorization. However, if Werehouse wants to directly speak
    ActivityPub, it basically needs to become an ActivityPub server! This is
    because of features like
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/security/"
      >Secure Mode in Mastodon</a
    >
    and
    <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.gotosocial.org/en/latest/federation/http_signatures/"
      >the default configuration for GoToSocial</a
    >. These features require that Werehouse provide a valid ActivityPub server
    signature on its requests, which in turn requires creating an “instance
    actor” to allow other ActivityPub servers to find its public key.
  </p>
  <p>
    Werehouse will eventually support ActivityPub properly, after I’ve had
    sufficient time to develop, test, and try out the ActivityPub code.
