<h1>What Do The Words Mean?</h1>
<dl>
  <dt id="d-animation">Animation</dt>
  <dd>
    A <a href="#d-video">Video</a> with no audio track. These can either be
    literally video files (<abbr>MP4</abbr>, <abbr>WEBM</abbr>) with no audio
    track, or animated <abbr>GIF</abbr> files.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-archive">Archive</dt>
  <dd>
    The collection of <a href="#d-record">Records</a> that you have saved in
    Werehouse.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-artist">Artist</dt>
  <dd>
    Someone who makes art, obviously! But more technically, a name and a
    collection of <a href="#d-handle">Handles</a> from various websites. This
    collection makes it easy to correctly attribute and link to the artist
    wherever they are online (and especially if they have different usernames on
    different websites).
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-content-hash">Content Hash</dt>
  <dd>
    A mathematical ‘summary’ of an image of an image that can be efficiently
    compared to other such summaries in order to determine if two images are
    ‘similar.’ For Werehouse’s purpose, ‘similar’ means that the two images
    contain pixels that are roughly the same brightness in roughly the same
    places. It can match images even when they have been resized, compressed
    (such as with <abbr>JPEG</abbr>), changed to grayscale, or
    <i>slightly</i> cropped. For the nerds, the algorithm Werehouse uses to
    determine this is variously called <i>Gradient Hash</i> or <i>dHash</i>. The
    implementation is based on

      >Dr. Neal Krawetz’s description on <cite>The Hacker Factor</cite></a
    >
    and the code of the
    <a href="https://github.com/abonander/img_hash"
      >Austin Bonander’s img_hash library</a
    >.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-handle">Handle</dt>
  <dd>
    A username and a profile page link for an <a href="#d-artist">Artist</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-image">Image</dt>
  <dd>An artwork that doesn’t move.</dd>

  <dt id="d-incoming-tag">Incoming Tag</dt>
  <dd>
    A tag that was associated with an image on some website, as found by the
    scraper. Incoming Tags are stored, but not displayed by default. If you
    later define a <a href="#d-tag-rule">Tag Rule</a> for that Incoming Tag,
    Werehouse will use the stored Incoming Tags to update every record with the
    <a href="#d-tag">Tag</a> you specified in your new Tag Rule.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-group">Group</dt>
  <dd>
    A collection of <a href="#d-record">Records</a> that are in a defined order.
    Particularly useful for comics, but also nice for collecting together an
    image and its alternate versions.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-ping-list">Ping List</dt>
  <dd>
    A list of your friends’ usernames, along with what
    <a href="#d-tag">Tags</a> in your <a href="#d-archive">Archive</a> they like
    and don’t like. When you share a <a href="#d-record">Record</a> from your
    archive using a <a href="#d-share-option">Share Option</a> that includes a
    ping list, Werehouse will reply to the initial share message with another
    message that pings/mentions the usernames who:
    <ul>
      <li>like <i>at least one</i> tag for that record, and</li>
      <li>dislike <i>none</i> of the tags for that record.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-queue">Queue</dt>
  <dd>
    The default way to archive something in Werehouse is to put it in the queue.
    Periodically (currently once per minute), Werehouse will take up to 10 of
    the oldest unprocessed items in your queue and attempt to archive them. It
    does this by downloading the link you provided, or using
    <a href="https://fuzzysearch.net">FuzzySearch</a> and
    <a href="https://fluffle.xyz">Fluffle.xyz</a> to find matching images on
    popular furry art websites.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-record">Record</dt>
  <dd>
    Something you’ve saved in Werehouse. Currently, Werehouse supports
    <a href="#d-image">Images</a>, <a href="#d-video">Videos</a>, and
    <a href="#d-animation">Animations</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-share-option">Share Option</dt>
  <dd>
    A way to send something from your <a href="#d-archive">Archive</a> to your
    friends, via another service. The only currently supported share option
    currently is <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a>, but
    <a href="https://discord.com/safety/using-webhooks-and-embeds"
      >Discord Webhooks</a
    >
    will be supported in the future. A Share Option can include a
    <a href="#d-ping-list">Ping List</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-tag">Tag</dt>
  <dd>
    A label for something that is depicted in a <a href="#d-record">Record</a>.
    You can apply as many tags as you like to a Record. However, trying to add
    the same tag to a Record more than once has no effect. You can also include
    a description for the tag, which helps distinguish between Portal (the video
    game by Valve) and Portals (the generic concept of a wormhole-like
    connection between two points in space). Or <cite>Dune</cite> (the book) and
    dune (the geological feature).
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-tag-rule">Tag Rule</dt>
  <dd>
    A rule which describes how to convert
    <a href="#d-incoming-tag">Incoming Tags</a> from other websites into
    <a href="#d-tag">Tags</a> in your archive. This is particularly useful when
    you find a site’s tagging conventions to be absurd or transphobic (<i
      >ahem,</i
    >
    e621) and would prefer not to be stuck with those conventions in your own
    archive.
  </dd>

  <dt id="d-video">Video</dt>
  <dd>A moving <a href="#d-image">Image</a> with sound.</dd>
