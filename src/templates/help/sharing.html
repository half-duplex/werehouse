<h1>Sharing</h1>
<p>Werehouse currently supports sharing to Telegram and Discord.  Both of these are configured through the <strong>Share Options</strong> system.</p>
<h2>Share Options</h2>
<p>To add a share option:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the <q>Add a Share Option…</q> link under <q>Share Options and Ping Lists</q> on your <a href="/account#sopl">account settings</a> page.</li>
    <li>Choose a name for the share option (which will only ever be shown to you).</li>
		<li>Choose the service through which you want to share: Telegram or Discord.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>For Telegram:</strong> Enter the Telegram chat ID of the chat or channel that you want Werehouse to send records to.  Since this is a fairly esoteric detail, WerehouseBot has a command to help.  Once you have added it to the group or channel (or convinced the admins to do it for you), you can send <tt>/chatid</tt>, and WerehouseBot will reply with the ID of the chat.</li>
			<li><strong>For Discord:</strong> Werehouse can share into a particular Discord channel using Discord’s Webhook API.  Follow <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks" target="_blank">Discord’s instructions for creating a Webhook</a>, then paste the Webhook URL that Discord gives you into the Webhook field.</li>
		</ul>
	  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you would like to also have Werehouse @-mention (also sometimes called <q>ping</q>) specific members of the chat when Werehouse is sending something that they might like, you can add a ping list to the share option.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Click the disclosure triangle that says <q>Include a ping list…</q>.</li>
    <li>This step differs based on which service you chose:
			<ul>
				<li><strong>For Telegram:</strong> Enter the full username (<em>including the <tt>@</tt> symbol</em>) of a chat member you’d like Werehouse to automatically mention.</li>
				<li><strong>For Discord:</strong> Enter a nickname (only shown to you) in the first field, and the channel member’s Discord User ID in the second field.  <strong>Note: Discord User IDs are not the same as Discord usernames.  A Discord User ID is a number with 15–20 digits.</strong>  Follow <a href="" target="_blank">Discord’s directions for finding User IDs</a> if you aren’t sure how to get them.</li>
  		</ul>
	  </li>
    <li>Click <q>Add Tags…</q>.  A new set of fields will appear below the username.</li>
    <li>Enter all the tags from your archive that the chat member is interested in.  If you enter a tag name that doesn’t exist already, Werehouse will create it for you.</li>
    <li>Enter all the tags from your archive that the chat member is <strong>not</strong> interested in.  The same rule about creating tags applies here too.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here’s how the sharing system works: When you share a record from your
	archive using a share option that includes a ping list, Werehouse will reply
	to the share messages with another message that pings/mentions the usernames who:</p>
<ul>
  <li>like <i>at least one</i> tag for that record, and</li>
  <li>dislike <i>none</i> of the tags for that record.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Linked Telegram Account</h2>
<p>In addition to sharing to groups using Share Options, Werehouse can also share directly to any Telegram account that you have linked with your Werehouse account.  This is particularly useful when you want to share with another person directly, or when adding the Werehouse bot to a group would be unwelcome or infeasable.</p>
<p>To link a Telegram account with Werehouse, send a message that says <tt>/start</tt> to <a target="_blank" href="https://t.me/werehouse_archive_bot">@WerehouseBot</a> on Telegram.  The bot will send you back a link that should show you a confirmation dialog (and possibly a login page, if you're not already logged in to Werehouse in the browser window that opens).</p>
<p>Once you have linked a Telegram account, it will appear in the drop-down menu anywhere that you can share a record (or record group).</p>
