<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Hello!  Welcome to Werehouse :3</p>
<p>Prior to building Werehouse, I was using a Telegram channel to archive
  artwork that I wanted to be able to find again later.  While this
  <em>worked</em>, I didn’t like that it was so hard to find things again, and
  that it was dependent on Telegram continuing to provide infinite free storage.
  This is the solution that I’ve built: an easily self-hostable web app that
  archives artwork, supports tagging, and can even share entries from your
  archive!</p>

<h2>How to Archive</h2>
<p>Werehouse supports archiving two different ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Automatically, through the queue; or</li>
  <li>Manually, by uploading an image.</li>
</ol>
<p>The queue can archive videos found on sites like Twitter or Bluesky, but
  manual archiving cannot.  For more information about how each of these
  work—and why manual archiving is limited that way (sorry)—see <a
  href="/help/how-queue-works">How It Works: Queue</a>.</p>

<h2>What’s In Your Archive</h2>
<p>Each entry in your archive is a single media file, with some metadata
  attached:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Kind (Image, Video, Animation): Which kind of media file is it?</li>
  <li>Dimensions: width and height</li>
  <li>Archive Date: when you added it to your archive</li>
  <li>Rating (General, Adult, Explicit, or Hard Kink): </li>
  <li>Categories (Stash, Reference, Moodboard, Sharing, Own Art): why you saved
    this artwork.  Unlike the above properties, an archive entry can be in
    multiple categories at once (or none at all).  Here’s what they are for:
    <ul>
      <li>Stash: You just like it and want to keep it around!</li>
      <li>Reference: The art is a reference guide of some kind, like a character
        sheet or tips on how to draw hands.</li>
      <li>Moodboard: You’re putting together a moodboard for an upcoming
        commission and want to collect things together. For example, <q>Oooh, I
        like how this piece depicts paw shoes,</q> or <q>the way this artist
          used posterization and a duotone effect gives me an idea!</q></li>
      <li>Sharing: You know someone who would like this!</li>
      <li>Own Art: Either you made this, or it’s of your character.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are also three other important kinds of information attached to records
  in your archive, and they deserve their own sections.</p>
<h3>Artists</h3>
<p>Today’s fragmented social media landscape more-or-less requires artists to
  post in many places.  In order to make sure artwork is saved in your archive
  with proper attribution, Werehouse has an extensive artist management system
  that helps you keep track of all of an artist’s accounts across various
  websites, and automatically add their name to anything you save from any of
  their accounts.  Werehouse tries its best to automate this, but there’s only
  so much it can do without human judgment involved.</p>
<p>To link an artist with an entry in your archive, just type in their name!
  Up-to-date browsers will autocomplete based on all of the artists you already
  have in your archive.  Once you’ve saved your changes to the record, you can
  click the artist’s name to add profile URLs (if you know any).</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll need to go through the list of artists in your archive and
  merge together entries for artists that are actually the same artist.  The
  artist list has a <q>Merge</q> button for exactly this purpose!  Right now,
  there’s no way to search or re-order the list, but you can rename one of the
  entries if it isn’t on the same page.  I’m working on a feature that
  automatically finds artists with similar usernames and suggests them to you
  for merging, but it isn’t ready yet.</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>Tags serve two purposes in Werehouse: helping you find things later, and
  feeding into the sharing system so that you can @-mention folks in a group
  chat when you share to it.</p>
<p>Adding tags to something is a lot of work, so whenever you archive from a
  source that already includes tags (such as FurAffinity or e621.net), Werehouse
will also import those tags and add them to a list you can access from the
  <q>Edit</q> menu of a record.  When you select tags from that list and save
  the record, Werehouse will ask you which of your tags should be applied for
  each of the incoming tags you selected, and then make a Tag Rule that
  automatically applies those tags for you in the future!  (Now that I have
  built up a library of 500-odd tag rules, I only have to do real tagging work
  for things that I archive from social media sites that don’t support tagging.
  It’s so much nicer!)</p>
<p>When you share using a <a href="/help/vocab#d-ping-list">share option with a ping list</a>,
  Werehouse will automatically @-mention people who you’ve configured as
  interested in the tags on that record.  For more details about how to set that
  up, check out the <a href="/help/sharing">help article on how sharing
    works</a>.</p>
<h3>Sources</h3>
<p>Werehouse keeps track of all the sources it knows about for any particular
  record.  It includes these when sharing, but also uses them to help you check
  for duplicates in your archive. <!--TODO: When you add a source yourself,
  Werehouse will automatically reformat the URL to a standard pattern (for
  supported websites) so that the duplicate checker works most
  effectively!--></p>

<h2>Sharing</h2>
<p>When you want to share something from your archive, <a
  href="/help/sharing">check out the options for sharing</a>!</p>

<h2>Learning More</h2>
<p>I’m still working on writing documentation, but I do have a bunch of it
  already!  The full list is <a href="/help">in the Help section</a>, but a good
  reference is <a href="/help/vocab">the vocabulary page</a>—I try to use words
  consistently throughout the interface, and this is a guide to what I meant by
  each of them.</p>
<p>And of course, if you have more questions that aren’t answered in the
  documentation (or if the documentation is unclear/insufficent), <a
href="https://github.com/s0ph0s-2/werehouse/issues/new">open an issue on
    GitHub</a> or message me about it!  I’m quite happy to help :3</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
